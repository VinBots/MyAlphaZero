# AlphaZero Documentation


I include below my personal notes on a few documents related to AlphAZero algorithm.


1. DeepMind's Original Paper
   [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270)


2. Udacity - Case Study on TicTacToe


3. Implementation Details
 
 - A short and effective introduction to AlphaZero is Surag Nair's
   [excellent tutorial](https://web.stanford.edu/~surag/posts/alphazero.html).
 - A good resource to learn about Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is this
   [Int8 tutorial](https://int8.io/monte-carlo-tree-search-beginners-guide/).
   [series of posts](https://medium.com/oracledevs/lessons-from-implementing-alphazero-7e36e9054191)
   from Oracle has been an important source of inspiration for `AlphaZero.jl`.
   It provides useful details on implementing asynchronous MCTS, along with
   an interesting discussion on hyperparameters tuning.


4. Discovery of AlphaZero.jl
