# MCTS

This package provides a simple way of using Monte Carlo Tree Search in any perfect information domain.  

## Installation 

With pip: `pip install mcts`

Without pip: Download the zip/tar.gz file of the [latest release](https://github.com/pbsinclair42/MCTS/releases), extract it, and run `python setup.py install`

## Quick Usage

In order to run MCTS, you must implement a `State` class which can fully describe the state of the world.  It must also implement four methods: 

- `getPossibleActions()`: Returns an iterable of all actions which can be taken from this state
- `takeAction(action)`: Returns the state which results from taking action `action`
- `isTerminal()`: Returns whether this state is a terminal state
- `getReward()`: Returns the reward for this state.  Only needed for terminal states. 

You must also choose a hashable representation for an action as used in `getPossibleActions` and `takeAction`.  Typically this would be a class with a custom `__hash__` method, but it could also simply be a tuple or a string.  

Once these have been implemented, running MCTS is as simple as initializing your starting state, then running:

```python
from mcts import mcts

mcts = mcts(timeLimit=1000)
bestAction = mcts.search(initialState=initialState)
```
See [naughtsandcrosses.py](https://github.com/pbsinclair42/MCTS/blob/master/naughtsandcrosses.py) for a simple example.
