# MyAlphaZero

This repository includes an implementation of AlphaZero algorithm applied to the TicTacToe game, based on Deepmind's paper, Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge, published in October 2017.

# Learning Objectives
* Self-play reinforcement learning techniques
* Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
* Implementation details (e.g. dirichlet noise, masking)
* Parallel implementations (via multiple processes) of game generations
* Python programming techniques

# Credits

* Jonathan Laurent (https://github.com/jonathan-laurent) for his supervision and guidance
* Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree (https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning)
